# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Generated on: 2025-08-20 04:56:27

## KEY FINDINGS

### Best Performing Model: XGBoost
- **Accuracy**: 80.2% of predictions are correct
- **Precision**: 72.9% of predicted churners actually churn
- **Recall**: 80.2% of actual churners are identified
- **F1-Score**: 0.749 (balanced performance metric)
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.623 (model discrimination ability)

### Dataset Overview
- **Total Customers**: 2,000
- **Churn Rate**: 17.9%
- **Features Used**: 11

## BUSINESS IMPACT

### What This Means for the Business:
1. **Accuracy of 80.2%** means the model correctly identifies customer behavior in approximately 80% of cases
2. **Precision of 72.9%** means that when the model predicts a customer will churn, it's correct 73% of the time
3. **Recall of 80.2%** means the model catches 80% of customers who actually churn

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Implement the XGBoost model** for churn prediction
2. **Focus retention efforts** on customers identified as high-risk
3. **Monitor model performance** monthly and retrain quarterly
4. **Investigate feature importance** to understand key churn drivers

## MODEL COMPARISON

The following models were evaluated:

- **LogisticRegression**: F1-Score 0.748, ROC-AUC 0.661
- **RandomForest**: F1-Score 0.736, ROC-AUC 0.642
- **XGBoost**: F1-Score 0.749, ROC-AUC 0.623

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Deployment**: Integrate the XGBoost model into the customer management system
2. **Monitoring**: Set up automated model performance tracking
3. **Action Planning**: Develop targeted retention strategies based on model predictions
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Schedule regular model retraining with new data

## TECHNICAL NOTES

- All models were trained using 1200 training samples
- Cross-validation was used to prevent overfitting
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize performance
- Models are saved and can be deployed immediately
