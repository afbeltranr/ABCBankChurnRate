# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis with BigQuery & Python 

## **Introduction**
This notebook is part of this **customer churn prediction project**, where we analyze bank customer data using **Google BigQuery** and **Python**. Our goal is to identify key factors influencing customer retention and to build a predictive model based on our findings.

## **ðŸ”— Key Milestones Achieved So Far**
âœ… **Cloud Integration**: We set up a **Google Cloud Service Account** to securely connect Kaggle datasets with BigQuery.  
âœ… **Database Setup**: The dataset was uploaded to **BigQuery** for efficient querying and analysis.  
âœ… **Local Execution**: Instead of downloading large files, we now run **SQL queries directly from this notebook** and retrieve data as Pandas DataFrames.  

## **ðŸ“Œ Current Focus**
ðŸ”¹ Writing and executing **SQL queries** in BigQuery to explore churn-related patterns.  
ðŸ”¹ Using **Python & Pandas** to analyze query results and create **visualizations**.  
ðŸ”¹ Investigating feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant variables for churn prediction.  

## **ðŸš€ Next Steps & Production Plan**
ðŸ”œ Transitioning from exploratory analysis to **machine learning modeling**.  
ðŸ”œ Designing a **CI/CD pipeline** for automating data ingestion and model updates.  
ðŸ”œ Deploying insights into a **dashboard or API** for real-time churn monitoring.
