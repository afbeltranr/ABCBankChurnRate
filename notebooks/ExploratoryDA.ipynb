    "\n",
    "#### **SQL Approach:**\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- ✅ Handles large datasets efficiently (server-side processing)\n",
    "- ✅ Explicit control over duplicate detection logic\n",
    "- ✅ Can be integrated into ETL pipelines\n",
    "- ✅ Memory efficient for very large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- ❌ More verbose syntax (need to specify all columns)\n",
    "- ❌ Less flexible for complex duplicate detection rules\n",
    "- ❌ Requires good understanding of window functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Python/Pandas Approach:**\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- ✅ Simple, concise syntax (`df.drop_duplicates()`)\n",
    "- ✅ Flexible - easy to specify subset of columns or custom logic\n",
    "- ✅ Integrated with data analysis workflow\n",
    "- ✅ Rich ecosystem for further data validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- ❌ Memory intensive for very large datasets\n",
    "- ❌ Slower for massive datasets compared to SQL\n",
    "- ❌ Requires loading full dataset into memory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Best Practice Recommendation:**\n",
    "- Use **SQL** for initial data cleaning in production ETL pipelines\n",
    "- Use **Python** for exploratory analysis and validation\n",
    "- Always validate that both approaches give consistent results (as we did above)"

    "1. **Gender**\n",
    "   - Slight imbalance in distribution (more females than males)\n",
    "   - Similar churn rates between groups\n",
    "   - **Modeling Decision**: Include as-is, but consider:\n",
    "     - Using stratification in train-test split\n",
    "     - Checking for interaction effects with other variables\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Country**\n",
    "   - Uneven distribution (Germany ~2x France/Spain)\n",
    "   - Different churn patterns across countries\n",
    "   - **Modeling Decision**: \n",
    "     - Convert to dummy variables\n",
    "     - Consider weighted sampling if using tree-based models\n",
    "     - Important feature to keep due to visible variation in churn rates\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Credit Card Status**\n",
    "   - Balanced distribution\n",
    "   - Similar churn rates between holders/non-holders\n",
    "   - **Modeling Decision**: Consider excluding due to low predictive power\n",
    "     - Run feature importance check to confirm\n",
    "     - Could be kept for interaction effects\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Active Member Status**\n",
    "   - Strong predictor: 2x churn rate for inactive members\n",
    "   - Clear separation between groups\n",
    "   - **Modeling Decision**: \n",
    "     - Definitely keep\n",
    "     - Consider as primary feature\n",
    "     - Check for interactions with balance and products_number\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Products Number**\n",
    "   - Higher churn for 3-4 products\n",
    "   - Non-linear relationship with churn\n",
    "   - **Modeling Decision**:\n",
    "     - Keep as categorical rather than continuous\n",
    "     - Consider binning into: low (1-2) and high (3-4) products\n",
    "     - Test both original and binned versions\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Tenure**\n",
    "   - Uniform distribution across groups\n",
    "   - Weak relationship with churn\n",
    "   - **Modeling Decision**:\n",
    "     - Test both as continuous and categorical\n",
